Summary of the Project: What does the project do? What technologies are used?
This project was a part of a larger project when applying to Pace's Federal Reserve Challenge team. I was tasked with creating a 5 presentation on a topic regarding the Federal Reserve. I chose to explain how the Federal Funds Rate works and how it is implemented. To create visuals, I decided to use R. I got an API Key from the LOUISIANA FRED to pull data, and then formatted the data into concise and eye-catching PNGS.
